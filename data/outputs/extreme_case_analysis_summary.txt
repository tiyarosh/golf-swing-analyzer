OVER-THE-TOP (OTT) ANALYSIS REPORT
======================================================================

 SWING PATH ANALYSIS
  Swing Path: 16.7° in-to-out
  Severity: Strong in-to-out path (may cause hooks)
  vs Tour Average: +15.2° (more in-to-out)
  Data Quality: Excellent (142 frames analyzed)

 INTERPRETATION GUIDE:
  • IN-TO-OUT path (positive °): Promotes draws, good for power
  • OUT-TO-IN path (negative °): OTT tendency, promotes slices
  • Optimal range: -2° to +2° (square to slight in-to-out)
  • Tour average: ~1.5° in-to-out

 SHOULDER ROTATION ANALYSIS
  Rotation Rate: 1.97°/frame
  Assessment: Optimal - Smooth rotation rate
  Within optimal range (1.0-2.5°/frame)
  Early Rotation: ⚠️  Yes - may contribute to OTT
  Data Quality: Excellent (140 frames)

 ROTATION CONTEXT:
  • Optimal: 1.0-2.5°/frame for smooth, powerful rotation
  • Too fast (>3.0°/frame): Often indicates OTT or early extension
  • Too slow (<1.0°/frame): May indicate restricted turn

⚠️  SHOULDER RECOMMENDATION:
  Fast early rotation detected. This often contributes to OTT.
  Focus on: Starting downswing with lower body, delaying
  shoulder turn until after hip rotation begins.

OVER-THE-TOP (OTT) ANALYSIS REPORT
======================================================================

 SWING PATH ANALYSIS
  Swing Path: 16.3° out-to-in
  Severity: Severe OTT - Significant out-to-in path
  vs Tour Average: -17.8° (more out-to-in)
  Data Quality: Excellent (28 frames analyzed)

 INTERPRETATION GUIDE:
  • IN-TO-OUT path (positive °): Promotes draws, good for power
  • OUT-TO-IN path (negative °): OTT tendency, promotes slices
  • Optimal range: -2° to +2° (square to slight in-to-out)
  • Tour average: ~1.5° in-to-out

 PRIORITY RECOMMENDATION:
  Your swing path shows significant out-to-in movement (over-the-top).
  Focus on: Dropping hands into slot, maintaining spine angle,
  and initiating downswing with lower body rotation.

 SHOULDER ROTATION ANALYSIS
  Rotation Rate: 16.03°/frame
  Assessment: Above optimal - Rotation may be too fast (OTT indicator)
  13.5°/frame faster than optimal
  Early Rotation: ✅ No
  Data Quality: Excellent (28 frames)

 ROTATION CONTEXT:
  • Optimal: 1.0-2.5°/frame for smooth, powerful rotation
  • Too fast (>3.0°/frame): Often indicates OTT or early extension
  • Too slow (<1.0°/frame): May indicate restricted turn

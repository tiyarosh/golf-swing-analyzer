OVER-THE-TOP (OTT) ANALYSIS REPORT
======================================================================

 SWING PATH ANALYSIS
  Swing Path: 0.5° (nearly square)
  Severity: Optimal - Excellent swing path
  vs Tour Average: -2.0° (more out-to-in)
  Data Quality: Excellent (36 frames analyzed)

 INTERPRETATION GUIDE:
  • IN-TO-OUT path (positive °): Promotes draws, good for power
  • OUT-TO-IN path (negative °): OTT tendency, promotes slices
  • Optimal range: -2° to +2° (square to slight in-to-out)
  • Tour average: ~1.5° in-to-out

 EXCELLENT:
  Your swing path is in the optimal range. Maintain this!

 SHOULDER ROTATION ANALYSIS
  Rotation Rate: 1.65°/frame
  Assessment: Optimal - Smooth rotation rate
  Within optimal range (1.0-2.5°/frame)
  Early Rotation: ✅ No
  Data Quality: Excellent (36 frames)

 ROTATION CONTEXT:
  • Optimal: 1.0-2.5°/frame for smooth, powerful rotation
  • Too fast (>3.0°/frame): Often indicates OTT or early extension
  • Too slow (<1.0°/frame): May indicate restricted turn
